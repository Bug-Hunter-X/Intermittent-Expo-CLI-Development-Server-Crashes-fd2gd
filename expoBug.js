While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without any clear error messages in the console. This would happen intermittently, making development very frustrating.  The project was a relatively simple React Native application with no particularly unusual dependencies. The crash wouldn't always occur at the same point in the application's lifecycle, and restarting the server would often temporarily resolve the problem.
